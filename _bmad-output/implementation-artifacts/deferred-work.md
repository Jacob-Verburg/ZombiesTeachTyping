## Deferred from: code review of story-1-1 (2026-10-02)

- `test_debug_disabled_in_release` does not verify that nothing printed; only the `is_level_enabled` seam is tested.
- `Log.verbose_typing` is declared but not consumed; wire it up when per-keystroke logging arrives (Epic 2).
- `directory_rules={"res://addons": 0}` not persisted in `project.godot`; relies on the Godot 4.7 default.
- `Log.debug` evaluates its `msg` argument even when DEBUG is disabled; keep calls out of hot paths.
- GUT plugin is enabled in `project.godot`; confirm the web export (Story 1.2) excludes `addons/gut`.

## Deferred from: dev of story-1-2 (2026-10-02)

- Web letterbox bars render **black**, not night `#2B1D3F` (DESIGN.md marks night bars as `[ASSUMPTION]`). Not required by Story 1.2 AC 5. Natural home: Story 5.0 (loading page / boot splash styling); options are the HTML page background in `html/head_include` plus the engine's black-bar color.
- Firefox checks for Story 1.2 AC 4/5 (load times, 1366×768 screenshot) were skipped because Firefox isn't installed. Stories 1.5 (key capture and quick-find) and 1.7 (reload and tab-close persistence, NFR4) require Firefox: install it before those stories, and re-run the 1.2 Firefox checks then.

## Deferred from: dev of story-1-3 (2026-10-02)

- Godot imports files inside `build/` (e.g. `build/web/index.icon.png.import` exists since the 1.2 export). Harmless: `build/` is gitignored and export-excluded. Add an empty `build/.gdignore` (recreated after each clean) or export outside the project if it ever slows imports.
- Font is Press Start 2P (wide, arcade look) because Pixelify Sans failed the O/0 check. If Story 1.9 or 5.0 wants a rounder face, any replacement must pass `test_ui_theme.gd` and have a native size that divides 16/24/32/64.

## Deferred from: code review of 1-3-screen-router-and-title-screen (2026-10-02)

- Router sets `get_tree().paused = false` unconditionally after every transition, which clobbers any pause owned elsewhere (e.g. Story 1.5's tab-blur pause) and pauses other autoloads (AudioManager) for 0.3 s per transition. Revisit when a second pause owner appears: save/restore prior state or centralise pause ownership.
- `Router.go()` during a transition is dropped with only a `Log.debug`. A screen that redirects from its own `_ready()` (e.g. Welcome Gift → Closet when already claimed) loses the redirect silently. Options: queue the last request, return a bool, or defer the redirect with `call_deferred` after `screen_changed`.
- On web, Godot dispatches buffered input from its main loop, not inside the browser's event handler. Story 1.4 must verify that `AudioManager.unlock()` called from `_unhandled_input` actually satisfies the browser gesture rule (Safari especially), or rely on the engine's own AudioContext resume.
- Placeholder button wiring (targets, payloads, Esc on Crypt Closet) and the title's once-only latch / unlock-before-go order are untested; needs a Router test double or injectable router reference.
